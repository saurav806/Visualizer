# Project Name: Algo Visualizer

# Description :
Algo Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to visualize various algorithms, focusing primarily on sorting and searching algorithms. Its purpose is to make complex algorithms more accessible and understandable by providing a visual representation of their execution.

With Algo Visualizer, you can witness the step-by-step execution of algorithms, observe how data elements are manipulated, and understand the underlying logic behind each algorithm. It aims to bridge the gap between abstract algorithmic concepts and their practical implementation.

# Key Features:
1. Sorting Algorithms: Algo Visualizer offers a wide range of sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. Each algorithm is visually represented, allowing you to follow along as elements get rearranged during the sorting process.

2. Searching Algorithms: Explore different searching algorithms, including Linear Search, Binary Search, and more. Witness how these algorithms traverse through the data set and identify the target element.

3. Real-Time Visualization: The tool provides a real-time visualization of the algorithms, allowing you to see each step and the effect it has on the data. This visual representation enhances your understanding of how algorithms work and their efficiency.

4. Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as data size, speed of execution, and visualization options to tailor the visual experience to your preferences. This flexibility enables you to experiment with different scenarios and observe algorithmic behavior under varying conditions.

5. Educational Resource: Algo Visualizer is not only a tool for practitioners but also serves as an educational resource for students and enthusiasts. By visualizing algorithms, it helps learners grasp complex concepts in a more intuitive manner, fostering a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

By using Algo Visualizer, you can gain a better understanding of sorting and searching algorithms, their time complexities, and the trade-offs between different approaches. Whether you are a student studying algorithms or a developer looking to optimize your code, Algo Visualizer is a valuable tool that combines functionality with visual appeal to enhance your learning experience.
